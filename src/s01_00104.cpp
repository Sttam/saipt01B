   Purpose        : give an understanding about the shell and OS dealing with you.

   Instructions   : 
                       ......
                       1. run ./s01_00103
                       2. run ./s01_00103 | grep saipt 
                       3. run ./s01_00103 | grep saipt >temp.txt

   Quiz yourself  :
                      1.  Line 2 is an expression. That is the reason why we are writing return EXIT_SUCCESS 
                      2.  What is the compiler doing with the expression
                      3.  What is the output of the program
                      4.  What is the output of the program if run ./s01B00103 & why?
                      5.  What is the output of the program if run ./s01B00103 | grep saipt
                      6.  What is the output of the program if run ./s01B00103 | grep saipt >temp.txt
                      7.  What happened to the stdin and stdout?
  
                      :) There could be more questions. Let us limit it here.
