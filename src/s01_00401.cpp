         Understanding of how type declarations operates.,

            1. Templates are confusing. So understand what is purpose.

           In the C++ programming language, a reference is a simple reference datatype that is less powerful 
           but safer than the pointer type inherited from C. The name C++ reference may cause confusion, 
           as in computer science a reference is a general concept datatype, with pointers and 
           C++ references being specific reference datatype implementations. The definition of a reference 
           in C++ is such that it does not need to exist. It can be implemented as a new name for an 
           existing object (similar to rename keyword in Ada).
