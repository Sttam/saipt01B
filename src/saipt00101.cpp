   Quiz yourself  :
                      1.  Where is the external variable std::cout declared
                      2.  Where is the external variable std::cout defined
                                   ( ios_base::basic_ios::::basic_ostream::ostream )
                      3.  Where is it instatiated.
                      4.  Why EXIT_SUCCESS is used instead of 0
                      5.  If we return( EXIT_SUCCESS) instead what is the implication
  
                      :) There could be more questions. Let us limit it here.
